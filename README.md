    Genres: Survival and Strategy 
    Inspiration: Boxhead, a web browser game that had players survive hordes of zombies.
    Rough Idea: An FPS split-screen game where players are in an enclosed environment and must look for different key components that help them escape. At the same time, players must survive hordes of different monsters.
